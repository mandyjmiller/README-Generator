## Description
As a developer, I want an application which can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project and ensures a professional output.


## Installation
Uses node.js and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).


## Usage
Instructions for use:
The application will be invoked by using the following command in the CLI
```bash
node index.js
```
This will call the the inquirer package to prompt questions which will populate the README file
