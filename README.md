## Description
As a developer, I want an application which can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project and ensures a professional output.

## Installation
Instructions for use:  The application will be invoked by using the following command in the CLI  ```bash  node index.js  ```  This will call the the inquirer package to prompt questions which will populate the README file

## Usage
Uses node.js and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

This video link will demonstrate a walkthrough of the application:
